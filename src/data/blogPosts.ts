    title: 'Building Scalable Web Applications with React and Node.js',
    excerpt: 'Learn best practices for creating scalable, maintainable web applications using modern JavaScript technologies.',
    content: `
      <p>Building scalable web applications requires careful planning, the right technology stack, and adherence to best practices. React and Node.js have become a popular combination for creating robust, scalable applications.</p>
      
      <h2>Architecture Considerations</h2>
      <p>When building scalable applications, architecture is paramount. Consider implementing microservices architecture to ensure different parts of your application can scale independently.</p>
      
      <h2>State Management</h2>
      <p>Proper state management is crucial for maintaining application performance as it grows. Consider using Redux, Zustand, or React Context API based on your application's complexity.</p>
      
      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      <p>Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and optimize your bundle size to ensure fast loading times even as your application grows.</p>
      
      <h2>Database Design</h2>
      <p>Design your database schema with scalability in mind. Consider using both SQL and NoSQL databases based on your specific use cases.</p>
